## Parallel Programming with Python

This is the repository for [Parallel Programming with Python](https://orangeava.com/products/parallel-programming-with-python), published by Orange AVA™


## About the Book
In this book, we will present various techniques currently available for parallel and concurrent programming with the Python language. There are numerous libraries and techniques that allow you to take advantage of different architectures available to make the calculation more efficient and performing (GPU, cores, resources distributed on the network, etc.). This book will introduce the readers gradually to the concepts behind these techniques with example codes.

This book will teach you everything about the powerful techniques and applications of parallel computing, from the basics of parallel programming to the cutting-edge innovations shaping the future of computing. 

The book starts with an introduction to parallel programming and the different types of parallelism, including parallel programming with threads and processes. The book then delves into asynchronous programming, distributed Python, and GPU programming with Python, providing you with the tools you need to optimize your programs for distributed and high-performance computing. 

The book also covers a wide range of applications for parallel computing, including data science, artificial intelligence, and other complex scientific simulations. You will learn about the challenges and opportunities presented by parallel computing for these applications and how to overcome them. 
By the end of the book, you will have insights into the future of parallel computing, the latest research and developments in the field, and explore the exciting possibilities that lie ahead.
